The application is doing the following:
@ Ask the user how many students will be added to the database
@ The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
@ Each student should have a 5-digit unique ID with the first digit being their year of study
@ A student can ONLY(added feature) enroll in the following courses:
  1. History 101
  2. Mathematics 101
  3. English 101
  4. Chemistry 101
  5. Computer Science 101
@ Each course costs Â£600 to enroll
@ The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
@ To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled and balance
